The document has various pieces of information printed on it, including the name \"Lei NÂ° 23 de Julio\" at the top, a date and time stamp in the middle, and a series of numbers below the date. There is also a watermark or holographic image visible on the right side. Additionally, there's a physical item resembling a fingerprint placed on top of the document, which suggests that the photo might have been taken shortly after the person's fingerprint was taken for the identification card or passport.
